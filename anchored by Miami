 <description>The South Florida region anchored by Miami and Fort Lauderdale is one of those regions boosters periodically proclaim to be on the verge of becoming &amp;ldquo;the next Silicon Valley&amp;rdquo; or at least a significant tech hub in its own right. Yet one of the perpetual obstacles in the way of progress toward that goal is a (real or perceived) shortage of tech talent to provide the brainpower for startups or even for more established companies looking to be more innovative in their use of IT.</description>

      <title>Which Developer Can Redeem Superman After A String Of Terrible Games?</title>
      <description>Superman is getting some wind back in his sails after an admittedly excellent new Batman V. Superman trailer debuted at Comic Con this past week. Though Man of Steel was the spark that set a thousand fanboy fires over its many missteps, there are few who aren&amp;rsquo;t excited to see him return and take on Batman in what&amp;rsquo;s considered to be the official launch of the DC Cinematic Universe.</description>

      <title>Are Consumer Networking Products Threatening Business Security?</title>
      <description>Security challenges are on the rise and a disproportionate amount of time and money is being spent to counter the intrusions and risks that lurk behind every door. While businesses may rely on enterprise-class networking security from companies like Cisco Systems, Fortinet, Checkpoint Systems or Palo Alto Networks, it is consumer products from the likes of Asus, D-Link, Linksys, Netgear or TRENDnet that could still have an unintended impact on a company&amp;rsquo;s networks and bottom line.
