[TOC]

NW.js project is in active development. And you are encouraged to contribute new features and bug fixes for the project.

Here is a general rule when you submit your pull request:

* Run test cases and make sure you didn't break any
* [Write proper test cases](Writing Test Cases for NW.js.md) to test your feature and bug
* [Write document](Writing Documents for NW.js.md) for your features
* Add your name and email to [AUTHORS](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/blob/nw13/AUTHORS)

We are liable to accept features which are **cross platform** and **easy to test**, to make NW.js in good shape and quality.
