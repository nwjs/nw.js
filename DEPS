# This file is used to manage the dependencies of the Chromium src repo. It is
# used by gclient to determine what version of each dependency to check out, and
# where.
#
# For more information, please refer to the official documentation:
#   https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/how-tos/get-the-code
#
# When adding a new dependency, please update the top-level .gitignore file
# to list the dependency's destination directory.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rolling deps
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All repositories in this file are git-based, using Chromium git mirrors where
# necessary (e.g., a git mirror is used when the source project is SVN-based).
# To update the revision that Chromium pulls for a given dependency:
#
#  # Create and switch to a new branch
#  git new-branch depsroll
#  # Run roll-dep (provided by depot_tools) giving the dep's path and optionally
#  # a regex that will match the line in this file that contains the current
#  # revision. The script ALWAYS rolls the dependency to the latest revision
#  # in origin/master. The path for the dep should start with src/.
#  roll-dep src/third_party/foo_package/src foo_package.git
#  # You should now have a modified DEPS file; commit and upload as normal
#  git commit -a
#  git cl upload
#
# For more on the syntax and semantics of this file, see:
#   https://bit.ly/chromium-gclient-conditionals
#
# which is a bit incomplete but the best documentation we have at the
# moment.

# We expect all git dependencies specified in this file to be in sync with git
# submodules (gitlinks).
